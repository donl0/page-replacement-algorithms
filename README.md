#Page replacement algorithms in operating Systems by c#

## Replacement algorithms

- [FIFO](https://github.com/donl0/page-replacement-algorithms/blob/main/Application/Replacer/FIFOReplacer.cs)

## Features
- [Loggers](https://github.com/donl0/page-replacement-algorithms/tree/main/ConsoleUI/Logger)

## How to run
[ConsoleUI](https://github.com/donl0/page-replacement-algorithms/tree/main/ConsoleUI) layer is also an sturtup project. His responsability is UI.
[Entry point](https://github.com/donl0/page-replacement-algorithms/blob/main/ConsoleUI/Program.cs) with specifying data.

## Plans

- LRU algorithm
- Optimal algorithm
